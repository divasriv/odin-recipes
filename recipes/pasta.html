    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Penne is an extruded pasta with cylinder-shaped pieces with an angle cut at the ends. Penne is the plural form of the Italian penna, which is derived from the Latin word penna, and is a cognate of the English word pen. This format was designed to mimic the steel nibs of fountain pens, which were popular at the time.</p>
    <p>Penne is a popular Italian pasta shape that is popular both in Italy and around the world. Penne translates to pen and gets its name from its shape, which is a short cylinder-shaped pasta with angled edges. A quill inspired the design. Penne originates in southern Italy's Campania region.</p>
